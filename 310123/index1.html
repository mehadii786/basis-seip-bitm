		<p>A Great Motivational Quote:</p>
		<blockquote>
		At the end of the day, you are solely responsible for your success and your failure. And the
sooner you realize that, you accept that, and integrate that into your work ethic. You will start
being successful. As long as you blame others for the reason you aren’t where you want to be,
you will always be a failure.At the end of the day, you are solely responsible for your success and your failure. And the
